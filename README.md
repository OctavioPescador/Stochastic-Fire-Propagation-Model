# Stochastic-Fire-Propagation-Model
Created a terrain-based cellular automata model that integrates environmental and physics-based modifiers into ignition dynamics. Findings provide a robust foundation for future calibration with empirical data and offer valuable insights for improving wildfire risk management and mitigation strategies.
